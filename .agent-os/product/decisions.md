## 2025-07-31: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Community Contributors

### Decision

Baseroo is established as a production-ready TypeScript library for base conversion between bases 2-64 with custom alphabet support, targeting developers building URL shorteners, encoding systems, and data processing applications. The library prioritizes reliability, zero dependencies, and comprehensive TypeScript support.

### Context

- Originated from popular Stack Overflow answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/32480941/1221906) addressing real developer pain points
- Community feedback drove evolution from basic Gist to full-featured package
- Primary use case: URL shortener development requiring compact, reliable ID encoding
- Secondary applications: data processing, custom encoding schemes, cryptographic applications

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Maintain as Gist/Stack Overflow Answer**

   - Pros: Simple, no maintenance overhead, already popular
   - Cons: Limited functionality, no testing, hard to extend, version management issues

2. **Build Full-Featured Encoding Library**

   - Pros: Comprehensive solution, broader market appeal
   - Cons: Feature creep, dependency complexity, maintenance burden

3. **Fork Existing Base Conversion Library**
   - Pros: Faster initial development, existing user base
   - Cons: Technical debt, compatibility constraints, limited customization

### Rationale

- **Community validation**: Stack Overflow answer popularity demonstrated real need
- **Focused scope**: Base conversion is well-defined problem with clear boundaries
- **Quality first**: 100% test coverage and zero dependencies ensure reliability
- **Developer experience**: TypeScript support and clear error handling reduce integration friction
- **Battle-tested foundation**: Years of community feedback provide solid requirements

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Reliable, well-tested solution for common developer need
- Minimal dependency footprint reduces security and maintenance concerns
- Strong TypeScript support improves developer experience
- Automated CI/CD ensures consistent quality
- Clear upgrade path for extending functionality

**Negative:**

- Limited scope may miss adjacent opportunities
- Zero dependencies constraint may limit future optimization options
- Maintenance responsibility for popular open source project

## 2025-07-31: Technology Stack Decisions

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Community Contributors

### Decision

Use TypeScript 5.7.3, Microbundle for building, Jest for testing, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and Semantic Release for automated publishing.

### Context

Library needs to support multiple JavaScript environments (Node.js, browsers, various module systems) while maintaining simplicity and reliability.

### Rationale

- **Microbundle**: Supports multiple export formats easily without complex configuration
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better developer experience
- **Jest**: Industry standard testing with excellent TypeScript integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Free for open source, integrates well with GitHub workflow
- **Semantic Release**: Automates versioning and publishing based on conventional commits

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Multiple export formats (CJS, ESM, UMD) support broad compatibility
- Automated quality gates prevent regressions
- Consistent release process reduces manual errors

**Negative:**

- Dependency on GitHub ecosystem
- Semantic Release learning curve for contributors

## 2025-07-31: Default Alphabet Decision

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Users

### Decision

Use `'0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ+/'` as default alphabet for base conversion.

### Context

Default alphabet determines what characters are used for bases 2-64, affecting URL safety and compatibility with different systems.

### Rationale

- Based on URL-safe character requirements for primary use case (URL shorteners)
- Compatible with Base64 encoding standards
- Avoids potentially confusing characters in basic usage
- Provides predictable, well-documented character mapping

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- URL-safe for primary use case
- Familiar to developers working with encoding
- Predictable behavior across different systems

**Negative:**

- May not be optimal for all use cases (hence custom alphabet support)
- Character order affects numeric value mapping

## 2025-07-31: Precision Limitation Decision

**ID:** DEC-004
**Status:** Accepted (Under Review for Phase 1)
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Technical Lead, Users

### Decision

Limit fractional precision to 10 decimal places in initial implementation, with plans to make this configurable in Phase 1.

### Context

Floating-point conversion requires balancing precision, performance, and predictable behavior across different number sizes.

### Rationale

- 10 decimal places covers most practical use cases
- Prevents infinite loops in conversion algorithms
- Provides consistent, predictable behavior
- Performance optimization for common operations

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Predictable conversion behavior
- Good performance for typical use cases
- Prevents algorithmic edge cases

**Negative:**

- May not meet needs for high-precision applications
- Hard-coded limit reduces flexibility

**Future Action:**

- Phase 1 will address configurable precision limits
- Research optimal algorithms for extended precision
