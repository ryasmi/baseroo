# Product Mission (Lite)

Baseroo is a TypeScript library that helps developers reliably convert numbers between different bases (2-64) by providing comprehensive base conversion with custom alphabet support, floating-point precision, and zero dependencies.

Baseroo serves developers building URL shorteners, encoding systems, and data processing applications who need reliable base conversion beyond standard JavaScript capabilities. Unlike other base conversion libraries, Baseroo provides battle-tested reliability from years of Stack Overflow community feedback, zero dependencies architecture, and innovative custom alphabet support for specialized encoding requirements.
