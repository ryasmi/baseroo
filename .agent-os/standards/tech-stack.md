# Tech Stack

## Context

Global tech stack defaults for Agent OS projects, overridable in project-specific `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md`.

Format below is “Alternatives vs Alternatives”. While we may occasionally use the alternatives on the right, we prefer to use the alternative(s) on the left more.

- Language Built-Ins vs Packages
- TypeScript vs Other Languages
- Github vs Other SCM Platforms
- Github Actions vs Other CI Tools
- VS Code vs Other Code Editors
