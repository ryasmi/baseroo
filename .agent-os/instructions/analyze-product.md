## Overview

Install Agent OS into an existing codebase, analyze current product state and progress. Builds on plan-product.md

<process_flow>

<step number="1" name="analyze_existing_codebase">

### Step 1: Analyze Existing Codebase

<step_metadata>
<action>deep codebase analysis</action>
<purpose>understand current state before documentation</purpose>
</step_metadata>

<analysis_areas>
<project_structure> - Directory organization - File naming patterns - Module structure - Build configuration
</project_structure>
<technology_stack> - Frameworks in use - Dependencies (package.json, Gemfile, requirements.txt, etc.) - Database systems - Infrastructure configuration
</technology_stack>
<implementation_progress> - Completed features - Work in progress - Authentication/authorization state - API endpoints - Database schema
</implementation_progress>
<code_patterns> - Coding style in use - Naming conventions - File organization patterns - Testing approach
</code_patterns>
</analysis_areas>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Thoroughly analyze the existing codebase
  DOCUMENT: Current technologies, features, and patterns
  IDENTIFY: Architectural decisions already made
  NOTE: Development progress and completed work
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="2" name="gather_product_context">

### Step 2: Gather Product Context

<step_metadata>
<supplements>codebase analysis</supplements>
<gathers>business context and future plans</gathers>
</step_metadata>

<context_questions>
Based on my analysis of your codebase, I can see you're building [OBSERVED_PRODUCT_TYPE].

To properly set up Agent OS, I need to understand:

1. **Product Vision**: What problem does this solve? Who are the target users?

2. **Current State**: Are there features I should know about that aren't obvious from the code?

3. **Roadmap**: What features are planned next? Any major refactoring planned?

4. **Decisions**: Are there important technical or product decisions I should document?

5. **Team Preferences**: Any coding standards or practices the team follows that I should capture?
   </context_questions>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Ask user for product context
  COMBINE: Merge user input with codebase analysis
  PREPARE: Information for plan-product.md execution
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="3" name="execute_plan_product">

### Step 3: Execute Plan-Product with Context

<step_metadata>

I'm installing Agent OS into an existing product. Here's what I've gathered:

**Main Idea**: [SUMMARY_FROM_ANALYSIS_AND_CONTEXT]

**Key Features**:

- Already Implemented: [LIST_FROM_ANALYSIS]
- Planned: [LIST_FROM_USER]

**Target Users**: [FROM_USER_RESPONSE]

**Tech Stack**: [DETECTED_STACK_WITH_VERSIONS]
</execution_prompt>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Execute plan-product.md with gathered information
  PROVIDE: All context as structured input
  ALLOW: plan-product.md to create .agent-os/product/ structure
</instructions>

</step>

<step number="4" name="customize_generated_files">

### Step 4: Customize Generated Documentation

<step_metadata>
<refines>generated documentation</refines>
<ensures>accuracy for existing product</ensures>
</step_metadata>

<customization_tasks>
<roadmap_adjustment> - Mark completed features as done - Move implemented items to "Phase 0: Already Completed" - Adjust future phases based on actual progress
</roadmap_adjustment>
<tech_stack_verification> - Verify detected versions are correct - Add any missing infrastructure details - Document actual deployment setup
</tech_stack_verification>
<decisions_documentation> - Add historical decisions that shaped current architecture - Document why certain technologies were chosen - Capture any pivots or major changes
</decisions_documentation>
</customization_tasks>

<roadmap_template>

## Phase 0: Already Completed

The following features have been implemented:

- [x] [FEATURE_1] - [DESCRIPTION_FROM_CODE]
- [x] [FEATURE_2] - [DESCRIPTION_FROM_CODE]
- [x] [FEATURE_3] - [DESCRIPTION_FROM_CODE]

## Phase 1: Current Development

- [ ] [IN_PROGRESS_FEATURE] - [DESCRIPTION]

[CONTINUE_WITH_STANDARD_PHASES]
</roadmap_template>

<instructions>
  ACTION: Update generated files to reflect reality
  MODIFY: Roadmap to show completed work
  VERIFY: Tech stack matches actual implementation
  ADD: Historical context to decisions.md
</instructions>

## âœ… Agent OS Successfully Installed

I've analyzed your [PRODUCT_TYPE] codebase and set up Agent OS with documentation that reflects your actual implementation.

### What I Found

- **Tech Stack**: [SUMMARY_OF_DETECTED_STACK]
- **Completed Features**: [COUNT] features already implemented
- **Code Style**: [DETECTED_PATTERNS]
- **Current Phase**: [IDENTIFIED_DEVELOPMENT_STAGE]

### What Was Created

- âœ“ Product documentation in `.agent-os/product/`
- âœ“ Roadmap with completed work in Phase 0
- âœ“ Tech stack reflecting actual dependencies

### Next Steps

1. Review the generated documentation in `.agent-os/product/`
2. Make any necessary adjustments to reflect your vision
3. See the Agent OS README for usage instructions: https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os
4. Start using Agent OS for your next feature:
   ```
   @/.agent-os/instructions/create-spec.md
   ```

Your codebase is now Agent OS-enabled! ðŸš€
